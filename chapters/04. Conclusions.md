## Conclusions

In this article I tried to describe all main unsupervised learning tasks and algorithms and give you a big picture of dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection and clustering.

I hope that these descriptions and recommendations will help you and motivate you to learn more and go deeper into machine learning.
