## Introduction

*Unsupervised learning* is a machine learning technique in which the users do not need to supervise the model. Instead, it allows the model to work on its own to discover patterns and information that was previously undetected. It mainly deals with the unlabelled data.

The most popular unsupervised learning tasks and algorithms for solving them are:
- **Dimensionality Reduction** - task of reducing the number of input features in a dataset:
  - *PCA*
  - *Manifold Learning* - *LLE*, *MDS*, *Isomap*, *t-SNE* and *LDA*
  - *Random Projections*
- **Clustering** - task of grouping simular instances into clusters:
  - *K-Means*
  - *HCA*
  - *DBSCAN*
  - *OPTICS*
  - *Affinity Propagation*
  - *Mean Shift*
  - *Spectral clustering*
  - *BIRCH*
  - *GMM*
- **Anomaly Detection** - also known as **outlier detection** - task of learning what "normal" data looks like and then use that information to detect abnormal instances:
  - *DBSCAN*
  - *GMM*
  - *Isolation Forest*
  - *LOF*
  - *One-class SVM*
  - *Fast-MCD*
- **Density Estimation** - task of estimating the *probability density function (PDF)* of the random process that generated the dataset. Density estimation is commonly used for anomaly detection (instances located in low-density regions are likely to be anomalies) and data analysis:
  - *GMM*
