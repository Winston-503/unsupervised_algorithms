## Introduction

*Unsupervised learning* is a machine learning technique in which the users do not need to supervise the model. Instead, it allows the model to work on its own to discover patterns and information that was previously undetected. It mainly deals with the unlabelled data.

The most popular unsupervised learning tasks and algorithms for solving them are:
- **Dimensionality Reduction** - task of reducing the number of input features in a dataset:
  - *PCA*
  - *Manifold Learning* - *LLE*, *Isomap*, *t-SNE*
  - *Autoencoders* and others
- **Clustering** - task of grouping simular instances into clusters:
  - *K-Means*
  - *Hierarchical Clustering*
  - *DBSCAN* and *OPTICS*
  - *Affinity Propagation*
  - *Mean Shift*
  - *Spectral Clustering*
  - *BIRCH*
  - *Gaussian Mixture Models*
- **Anomaly Detection** - the task of detecting instances that are very different from the norm:
  - *Isolation Forest*
  - *Local Outlier Factor*
  - *Minimum Covariance Determinant*
  - other algorithms
